# Students Dropout/Graduate Prediction

Higher education is one of the key elements for many students to be able to enter the
job market. Although many students successfully complete their studies, there are still
some who drop out, which affects not only the students, but also the level of education
at the university and in the country. If universities can predict students who are prone
to dropping out, they can apply methods, organize special care programs or even assign
mentors to guide them, in order to increase their student success rate in their program.
Then the problem addressed is defined in the classification of students with a tend-
ency to graduate or dropout from their respective program, using the details of the enrol-
ment, including academic background, socio-economic factors and family background
